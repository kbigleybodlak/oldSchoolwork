/* 1.
Plateau program (max sequence length)  (a combinatorial algorithm)  
The array a(1..n) contains sorted integers. 
Write a function maxlen(a,n) that returns the length of the longest sequence of  identical numbers 
(for example, if a=(1,1,1,2,3,3,5,6,6,6,6,7,9) 
then maxlen returns 4 because the longest sequence 6,6,6,6 contains 4 numbers. 
Write a demo main program for testing the work of maxlen.  
Explain your solution, and insert comments in your program. 
The solution should have time complexity O(n).
